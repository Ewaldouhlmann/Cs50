sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Because in large sorted number is so much better than sort3,
and because sort2 is much faster than the other in large random numbers, we premuse that
sort 2 is merge sort

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Because in most part of tests, it's so much
efficient than the other(especially in random numbers).

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Because is less efficient that sort 2 in random tests and also
less efficient that sort 1 in sorted tests.
